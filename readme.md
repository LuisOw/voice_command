# voice_command

## That's my first try to make a voice commanded program

## In order to make it word you must install: 
### SpeechRecognition, gTTS, playsound and pydub

## A simple pip install deal with all of that

# How that shit works?
## Just use python to interpret it
> python voice.py
## After that you'll have to chose the output formar either text ou voice and start speacking
